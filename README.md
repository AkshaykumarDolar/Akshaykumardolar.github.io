**🚆 DLR - Train Departure Losses Analytics Dashboard**

Technologies Used: Power BI, Excel

This project analyses DLR train departure losses to identify operational disruption patterns and support improvements in service reliability through data-driven insights.

🔍 What this dashboard does
•Departure Loss Analysis: Tracks total and periodic departure losses across multiple time periods to highlight operational impact.
•Trend & Time Analysis: Visualises departure losses by year, month, and period number to identify recurring peaks and seasonal patterns.
•Root Cause Insights: Breaks down losses by problem code groups (e.g. Doors, ATO, Traction, Auxiliaries) to pinpoint key drivers of disruption.
•Responsibility Analysis: Shows departure losses by responsible manager and department, enabling clearer accountability and targeted action.
•Detailed Drill-Down: Provides record-level visibility to investigate specific incidents by date, problem type, and ownership.

📊 Outcome & Value
•Improved visibility into where and why departure losses occur
•Enabled teams to prioritise high-impact problem areas
•Supported operational planning to reduce delays and service disruption
•Delivered a clear, interactive dashboard for both strategic overview and detailed investigation

🔜 Next Steps

**🚄 Eurostar - Stock Risk & Consumption Analytics Dashboard**

Technologies Used: Power BI, Excel, Automation Tools

This project delivers an end-to-end analytics solution to monitor stock consumption patterns, identify supply risk, and support data-driven inventory decisions for Eurostar operations.

🔍 What this dashboard does
•Stock Risk Classification: Automatically classifies parts into Green, Amber, and Red risk categories based on consumption trends and stock coverage.
•Consumption Analysis: Calculates total consumption for 2021, 2022, and a rolling 2023 average to identify long-term demand patterns.
•Monthly Coverage Insights: Evaluates how long current stock will last under existing consumption rates, helping teams anticipate shortages.
•Trend & Store Analysis: Visualises consumption tendencies over time by store, part number, repairability, and international sourcing.
•Decision Support: Highlights high-risk parts and over-consumed items to support procurement planning and stock optimisation.

⚙️ Automation & Efficiency
•Built automated weekly reporting, including CSV exports and email distribution, reducing manual effort and ensuring stakeholders receive up-to-date insights consistently.

📊 Outcome & Value
•Improved visibility into stock risk and consumption behaviour.
•Enabled proactive inventory decisions rather than reactive fixes.
•Reduced manual reporting dependency through automation.
•Provided a scalable dashboard that supports ongoing operational planning.

🔜 Next Steps
•Integrate live stock feeds for real-time risk alerts.
•Extend risk logic with lead-time and supplier reliability metrics.
